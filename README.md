# learn riot.js

If you read Twitter or Medium it seems like ***ALL*** the "***KÃ¼el Kids***" are *jumping* on the ***React.js Bandwagon***...

Mostly because Facebook are doing a *great* ***Marketing Job*** of making it *Fashionable*...

But just like *every* other fashionable framework-du-jour ...
> ***take*** *a* ***moment*** *to* ***think*** *about* ***exactly*** *what* ***problem*** *we are* ***trying*** *to* ***solve*** ...

*instead of getting* ***sucked*** *into using the* ***fashionable framework***,
we can take step back and *objectively* *consider*

We would *prefer* to use ***native*** **Web Components**
because they are a ***Web Standard***: http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components#w3c_all

But *sadly*, there is not yet widespread adoption for them in the major browsers: http://caniuse.com/#search=components

So, while we *wait* for Internet Explorer to catch up, we are thinking of using http://riotjs.com because its *much* smaller and
thus *faster-to-learn* than anything else out there...

A quick introduction to the [Riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs) client side MVP library for people who want to build minimalist apps.

## Why?

> "Riot is an incredibly fast, powerful yet tiny client side (MV*)
library for building large scale web applications."

### What does that even mean?

Read the full detail in [Tero Piirainen](https://github.com/tipiirai)'s post introducing Riot: <br />
https://muut.com/blog/technology/riotjs-the-1kb-mvp-framework.html

## What?

## *How*?

If you are *wondering* ***how*** you can `require()` a `.tag` file
( *that is not `.js` or `.json` -
  the standard files you require in node.js* )
The answer is *simple*: when you `require('riot')`
the `riot` *module* ***extends*** node's native `require` method
(*this is* ****JavaScirpt*** *after all, everything is accessible*)
which means that `require()` *understands* how to load a `.tag` file.

## Background

I've built ("single page") apps using Angular.js, Backbone.js, Ember.js and Meteor.
All of them are *fantastic* frameworks, each have pros & cons.
For me, the biggest downside of Angular.js is having to put ng-etc in the html.
Ember.js is *massive*, we used it @GRPN because it was considered the "best" option back then.
Backbone has excessive boilerplate but comparatively lightweight.
