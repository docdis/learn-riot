## Background

I've built ("single page") apps using Angular.js, Backbone.js, Ember.js and Meteor.
All of them are *fantastic* frameworks, each have pros & cons.
For me, the biggest downside of Angular.js is having to put ng-etc in the html.
Ember.js is *massive*, we used it @GRPN because it was considered the "best" option back then.
Backbone has excessive boilerplate but comparatively lightweight.
{{ insert  comparison of frameworks ? }}
